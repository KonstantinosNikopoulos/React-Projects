# To do app in React

## Run locally

You need to have node.js installed. I am using node version `12.17` and npm version `6.14.4`, but you can use any modern node/npm version you want. When you are ready, you can install all dependencies and run the development servers by typing the below commands:

```
npm install
npm start // Runs the create react app server in port 3000
open http://localhost:3000
```
